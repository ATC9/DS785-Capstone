# DS785-Capstone
Capstone Code

The code here are the various Python scripts/notebooks used for data prep, feature engineering, statistical modeling, and visualization. 

Source data was all downloaded from the PGA Tour website, as well as the Bureau of Labor Statistics for relevant CPI data. 

Any/all reference to file directories have been redacted. Each block of code is separated by ###, whee appropriate. Code is commentated briefly and concisely. 

There are 7 individual notebooks present here. I started with data processing/wrangling, moved on to exploratory data analysis, and then began modeling --- first using the traditional stats panel data set. Then I replicated a nearly identical workflow using strokes gained metrics, although the code written for the strokes gained workflow is a bit more efficient. 

Order of workbooks:
1. PGA Tour Traditional Statistics Data Processing
2. EDA Traditional Stats
3. PGA Tour Modeling Traditional Statistics
4. PGA Tour Strokes Gained Metrics Data Processing
5. EDA Strokes Gained Model
6. PGA Tour Modeling Stokes Gained Metrics
7. Coefficient Magnitude --- this was an easy, lazy way to create bar chart visuals used in the discussion portion of the capstone paper. I could have easily done this in any software, but kept it in the Python environment to be consistent.
